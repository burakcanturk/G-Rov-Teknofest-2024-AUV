# G-Rov-Teknofest-2024-AUV

This is a team named "G-Rov"'s auv (autonomous underwater vehicle) remote operating interface. This program runs on Jetson Xavier Nx that the system's computer. This system uses Jetson Xavier Nx because its GPU is better than any other mini computers. So, we can do image processing very fast with using YOLOv10.
